  As part of a memory management package for storing variable-length records in a large memory
space, in this project we will build some necessary data structures for doing search and analysis
on a large song database. The records that you will store for this project are artist names and song
track names from a subset of the Million Song database.

  To store data for the song records, we will simplify the memory management. You
should create a large array of bytes to store all songs and artist names. The artist names and song
titles will be stored separately. For each record, the first byte (called flag) will be a sign to mark
whether the data is active (0 means deleted and 1 means active). The next two bytes will be the
(unsigned) length of the record, in (encoded) characters. Thus, the total length of a record may
not be more than 2 16 = 65536 characters or bytes. Following that will be the string itself. Access
to all records will be controlled by ‚Äúhandles‚Äù. For each handle, it contains the start location
(within the array) of the record.

  To simplify the implementation, for insertion, append the new record to the last record of
your array and mark it as active; For deletion, mark the corresponding data as deleted, but you
don‚Äôt have to physically remove the record from the array. Whenever the array size is not enough,
you will create a new array with larger size and copy the old data to the new array. Access to the
song records will be through several index files: two closed hash tables for accessing artist names
and accessing song titles, and two 2-3+ (or BST) trees for range query.
For the hash tables, you will use the second string hash function described in the book,
(the hash function will be provided by your instructors), and you will use simple quadratic
probing for your collision resolution method (the i'th probe step will be ùëñ
2 slots from the home slot). The key difference from what the book describes is that your hash tables must be extensible.
That is, you will start with a hash table of a certain size, (defined when the program starts). If the
hash table exceeds 50% full, then you will replace the array with another that is twice the size,
and rehash all of the records from the old array. For example, say that the hash table has 100 slots.
Inserting 50 records is OK. When you try to insert the 51st record, you would first re-hash all of
the original 50 records into a table of 200 slots. Likewise, if the hash table started with 101 slots,
you would also double it (to 202) just before inserting the 51st record. The hash tables will
actually store ‚Äúhandles‚Äù to the relevant data records that are currently stored in the memory. This
handle is used to recover the record. For this project, it will be just the index of the data in the
array.

  You will also implement a 2-3+ (or BST) tree to support the search query. The data
records to be stored in the 2-3+ tree are objects of the class KVPair, where the key is a handle,
and the value is another handle. Your Handle class should be made to support the Comparable
interface. To simplify implementation, we want to avoid storing records with duplicate keys. So
while we use the ‚Äúkey‚Äù field when comparing records, if they have the same value in the key 
(because they refer to the same artist, or to the same song), we will then use the value of the
handle (location) in the value position of the KVPair to break the tie. For example, if one record
has handle 10 in the key field and handle 30 in the value field, while another record has handle 10
in the key field and handle 40 in the value field, then the first one would appear in list of leaf
nodes before the second. Whenever an insert command is called with a song/artist pair, the
handles for these two strings will then be used to enter two new entries into the 2-3+ (or BST)
tree. If the artist's name handle is named artistHandle and the song's name handle is named
songHandle, then you will create and insert a KVPair object with the artistHandle as the key and
the songHandle as the value field in the ‚Äúartist‚Äù tree. You will then create and insert a second
KVPair object with the songHandle as the key and the artistHandle as the value field in the ‚Äúsong‚Äù
tree. However, be sure not to insert a duplicate artist/song record into the database, (i.e., array). If
there already exists a KVPair object in the 2-3+ (or BST) tree with those same handles, then you
will not add the song pair again. When a list command is processed, you will first get the handle
for the associated string from the hash table. You will then search for that handle in the 2-3+ (or
BST) tree and print out all records that have been found with that key value. When a remove
command is processed, you will be removing all records associated with a given artist or song
name. To (greatly!) simplify removing the records from the 2-3+ (or BST) tree, you will remove
them one at a time. So, you will search for the first record matching the corresponding handle for
the name that you want to delete, then call the (single record) delete operation on it, and repeat
this process for as long as there is a record matching that handle in the tree. Also, whenever you
remove a particular record (say, an artist/song pair), you will immediately remove the
corresponding song/artist record. Finally, whenever you remove the last instance of either an
artist or a song, you should always remove the associated record from the hash table and mark the
string deleted (value 0) in the database memory, (i.e., the array).

  When implementing the 2-3+ (or BST) tree, all major functions (insert, delete, search)
must be implemented recursively. You may not store a parent pointer for the nodes. Your nodes
must be implemented as a class hierarchy with a node base class along with leaf and internal node
subclasses. For a 2-3+ tree implementation, internal nodes store two values (of type KVPair) and
three pointers to the node base class. Leaf nodes store two KVPair records.

Invocation and I/O Files:

  The program would be invoked from the command-line as:
java SongSearch {initial-hash-size} {block-size} {command-file}
The name of the program is SongSearch. Parameter {initial-hash-size} is the initial size of the
hash table (in terms of slots). Parameter {block-size} is the initial size of the array in bytes to
store the song records. Whenever the array has insufficient space to insert the next request, it will
be replaced by a new array that adds additional {block-size} bytes. All data from the old array
will be copied over to the new array, and then the new string will be added.
Your program will read from text file {command-file} a series of commands, with one
command per line. The program should terminate after reading the end of the file. The formats for
the commands are as follows. The commands are free-format in that any number of spaces may
come before, between, or after the command name and its parameters. All commands should
generate a suitable output message (some have specific requirements defined below). All output
should be written to standard output. Every command that is processed should generate some sort
of output message to indicate whether the command was successful or not.
insert {artist-name}<SEP>{song-name}

  Note that the characters <SEP> are literally a part of the string (this is how the raw data
actually comes to us, and we are preserving this to minimize inconsistencies in other projects),
and are used to separate the artist name from the song name. Check if {artist-name} appears in
the artist hash table, and if it does not, add that artist name to the memory, and store the resulting
handle in the appropriate slot of the artist hash table. Likewise, check if {song-name} appears in
the song hash table, and if it does not, add that song name to the memory, and store the resulting
handle in the appropriate slot of the song hash table. You should print a message if the insert
causes a hash table or the memory pool to expand in size.

remove {artist|song} {name}
  Remove the specified artist or song name from the appropriate hash table, 2-3+ (or BST)
tree and make corresponding marks in the memory. Report the outcome (whether the name
appears, and whether it was successfully removed).

print {artist|song}
  Depending on the parameter value, you will print out either a complete listing of the
artists contained in the database, or the songs. For artists or songs, simply move sequentially
through the associated hash table, retrieving the strings and printing them in the order
encountered (along with the slot number where it appears in the hash table). Then print the total
number of artists or total number of songs.

list {artist|song} {name}
  If the first parameter is artist, then all songs by the artist with name {name} are listed. If
the first parameter is song, then all artists who have recorded that song are listed. They should be
listed in the order that they appear in the 2-3+ (or BST) tree.

delete {artist-name}<SEP>{song-name}
  Delete the specific record for this particular song by this particular artist. This means
removing two records from the 2-3+ (or BST) tree, undoing the insert. If this is the last instance of
that artist or of that song, then it needs to be removed from its hash table and the memory pool. In
contrast, the remove command removes all instances of a given artist or song from the 2-3+ (or
BST) tree as well as the hash table and memory pool.

print tree
  You will print out an in-order traversal of the 2-3+ tree (or BST) as follows. First, before
printing the tree, you should print out on its own line: ‚ÄúPrinting 2-3 tree:‚Äù or ‚ÄúPrinting BST:‚Äù.
Each node is printed on its own line. Each node is indented by its depth times two spaces. So the
root is not indented, its children are indented 2 spaces, its grandchildren 4 spaces, and so on.
Internal nodes list the (one or two) placeholder records (both the key and the value for each one).
That is, if an internal node stores a key (a handle) whose corresponding string is at position 10 in
the memory, and a value handle with memory position 20, then you would print 10 20. Leaf
nodes print, for each record it stores, the two handle positions. So they will print either 2 or 4
numbers. The numbers should be separated by a space.
